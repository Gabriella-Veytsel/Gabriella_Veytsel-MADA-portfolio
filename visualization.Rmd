For this exercise, I chose to replicate an interactive map:
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/

<img src="C:/Users/Gabriella Veytsel/Desktop/MADA 2021/Gabriella_Veytsel-MADA-portfolio/Map.jpg" alt="drawing" width="600"/> 

Data used in The Atlas Of Redistricting: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/redistricting-atlas-data

Weirdly, though knit worked without errors, building the website didn't work until I substituted select() with subset() when using pipes with spatial data  

```{r packages, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = FALSE}
#Load packages
library(raster)
library(rgdal) 
library(sf)#st_read to read shapefiles
library(maptools)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet) #interactive map
library(tigris)
library(grid)
library(tmap) 
library(RColorBrewer)
```

Why are some states missing "current" district shapefiles?   

According to the readme in GitHub "In cases where the current congressional map fulfilled the goals of a custom map for a state, a shapefile is not included." What shapefiles did they use then? 

MAPTYPE = Current : "The current congressional boundaries"
```{r data1, results = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#Load the shapefiles
baseDir = "C:/Users/Gabriella Veytsel/Desktop/MADA 2021/Gabriella_Veytsel-MADA-portfolio/data/redistricting-atlas-data-master/shp"

#There are multiple shapefiles for each state in the shp folder
#For this map, looks like they the shapefile with MAPTYPE = current 
filenames <- dir(baseDir, "*current.shp") 
filepaths <- paste(baseDir, filenames, sep='/')

listOfShp <- lapply(filepaths, st_read) #read each file into a list
all_shapefiles <- do.call(rbind, listOfShp) #combine shapefiles into one

#Load the metadata
districts <- read_csv("C:/Users/Gabriella Veytsel/Desktop/MADA 2021/Gabriella_Veytsel-MADA-portfolio/data/redistricting-atlas-data-master/districts.csv")
```

Found missing state shapefiles from census website, will use them to supplement the missing ones
https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/PREVGENZ/cd/cd103shp/
```{r data2, results = FALSE}
baseDir_state <- "C:/Users/Gabriella Veytsel/Desktop/MADA 2021/Gabriella_Veytsel-MADA-portfolio/data/redistricting-atlas-data-master/shp_gv_census/Missing Shapefiles"

filenames_state <- dir(baseDir_state, "*.shp") 
filepaths_state <- paste(baseDir_state, filenames_state, sep='/')

listOfShp_state <- lapply(filepaths_state, st_read) #read each file into a list
all_shapefiles_state <- do.call(bind_rows, listOfShp_state) #combine shapefiles into one

#These states only have 1 congressional district
all_shapefiles_state <- subset(all_shapefiles_state, select =ST)

#Missing state names
table(all_shapefiles_state$ST)
all_shapefiles_state <- all_shapefiles_state %>%
  mutate(STATE = case_when(
         (ST == "02") ~ "AK",
         (ST == "56") ~ "WY",
         (ST == "30") ~ "MT",
         (ST == "38") ~ "ND",
         (ST == "46") ~ "SD",
         (ST == "50") ~ "VT"))
```

Merge metadata with each shapefile (different criteria for keys)
```{r}
all_shapefiles_state_merge <- merge(all_shapefiles_state, districts, by.x = "STATE", by.y = "state") %>%
  filter(maptype == "current")

districts_merge <- merge(all_shapefiles, districts, by.x=c("MAPTYPE", "STATE", "DISTRICT"), by.y=c("maptype", "state", "district")) 
```

Merge shapefiles together
```{r}
districts_merge <- bind_rows(all_shapefiles_state_merge, districts_merge) 
districts_merge <- subset(districts_merge, select = -c(maptype, ST, district, statefp))
```

Explore the variable dem_chance for choropleth  

dem_chance: The probabilities of electing a Democrat or Republican are based on how often seats with a given Cook PVI elected members of each party between 2006 and 2016. 
```{r}
glimpse(districts_merge)
summary(districts_merge$dem_chance)
```
In a separate article, I found information on the bottom legend of their map:

PVI (Cook Partisan Voting Index) measures how much more Democratic or Republican a district voted relative to the national result in an average of the last two presidential elections. We categorized partisanship into three "buckets":

* Usually Democratic districts (those with an estimated PVI score of D+5 or higher - in other words, at least 5 percentage points more Democratic than the nation)  
* Competitive districts (those with an estimated PVI score between D+5 and R+5)  
* Usually Republican districts (those with an estimated PVI score of R+5 or higher)

```{r}
districts_PVI <- districts %>%
  filter(maptype == "current") %>%
  mutate(district_pvi = 
         ifelse(between(PVI, -5, 5), "HIGHLY COMPETITIVE DISTRICTS",
         ifelse(PVI < -5, "USUALLY REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS",
         ifelse(PVI > 5, "USUALLY DEMOCRATIC DISTRICTS", 0))))
table(districts_PVI$district_pvi, useNA = "always")
```

```{r, results = FALSE, message = FALSE}
state_pvi <- districts_PVI %>%

  group_by(state, statefp, district_pvi) %>%
  summarize(n = n())

state_pvi <- spread(state_pvi, district_pvi, n) #have to tidy dataset for all 3 rows to appear on map
state_pvi[is.na(state_pvi)] <- 0 #if missing, make 0

state_map <- st_read("C:/Users/Gabriella Veytsel/Desktop/MADA 2021/Gabriella_Veytsel-MADA-portfolio/data/redistricting-atlas-data-master/shp_gv_census/gz_2010_us_040_00_500k.shp")

states_merge <- merge(state_map, state_pvi, by.x = "STATE", by.y = "statefp")

Plot choropleth using leaflet package  
Struggling to move Hawaii, tried using the grid package and st_transform  
Hover over each state with mouse
